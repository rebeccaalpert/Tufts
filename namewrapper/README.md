# namewrapper

Namewrapper is a data processing tool that was used to speed up website updates for Tufts University's #GivingTuesday promotion in 2015 and 2016. Names were manually added to an online donor roll over the course of the day as donations rolled in. The tool made the process faster as the person entering the data didn't need to copy and paste HTML tags hundreds of times; they only had to paste a block of names into Namewrapper and then copy the processed names into the donor roll HTML.

It takes text input via a textarea. When the form is submitted, it wraps the text in a div and wraps each line of text in a hard-coded span.
